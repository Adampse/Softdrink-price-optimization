# Softdrink-price-optimization
This repository contains a subset of the UofC Dominik's Finer Foods dataset focusing solely on the quantity and price of soft drinks sold between 1987 and 1991. The dataset was cleaned to remove 4 entries from store 146 which had null values, then split up into 4 categories based on price, and one stand alone store, store #112.
